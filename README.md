# Pre-Seasonal-Streamflow-Forecasting
This project develops a pre-seasonal streamflow forecasting framework for the Michipicoten River watershed, Canada. April–June streamflow is predicted using January–March ERA5 hydroclimatic predictors. PCR is compared with MLR, showing improved stability and accuracy, with SWE as the dominant predictor.
